\section{introduction.}
Google Optimization Tools (OR-Tools) is a fast and portable software suite for solving combinatorial optimization problems. The suite contains:

A constraint programming solver.
A simple and unified interface to several linear programming and mixed integer programming solvers, including CBC, CLP, GLOP, GLPK, Gurobi, CPLEX, and SCIP.
Graph algorithms (shortest paths, min cost flow, max flow, linear sum assignment).
Algorithms for the Traveling Salesman Problem and Vehicle Routing Problem.
Bin packing and knapsack algorithms.

\section{BODY.}
If your site testing tool doesn’t integrate deeply with the data sources that matter most to your business, like your site analytics data, you can end up with conflicting results that can’t be reconciled.

Fortunately, Optimize is natively integrated with Google Analytics, which means all of your data comes from a single data source. Use your Analytics site data to quickly and easily identify areas where your website performance can be improved. Then, turn these insights into action through experimentation to deliver an online experience that works best for your customers.\\

\section{CONCLUSION.}
Any business with a physical location should be using local search engine optimization. However, local SEO, though very important, is not always simple. It requires knowledge of the many techniques and methods that will get Google to notice you, as well as an abundance of time.
